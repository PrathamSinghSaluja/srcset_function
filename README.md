This project works exactly like "srcset" function should work
Here one default image is shown and user has to input 2 images first for the width of device greater than 650px.
Then Second Image for the width of device greater than 465px.
If your device is having width greater than 650px one image will display
If device width is greater than 465px another image will display
If device width is less than 465px the default image will be displayed.
